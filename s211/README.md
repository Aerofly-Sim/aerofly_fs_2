INITIAL RELEASE


Features:
*********
It is clear to me that I will not have the time, at least for several months, to bring the SIAI-Marchetti S.211 for Aerofly FS2 to the same level of quality of the FSX/Prepar3D version. But if there is a thing I despise is waste my work. So I decided to release it "as is" as freeware for everybody to enjoy.
"As is" means that is it still somewhat incomplete: that is radios, the navigation instruments and some gauges are not working and the flight model is "decent" but far from the "flight manual" accuracy of the FSX/P3D version. Also, steering the aicraft on the ground is quite difficult (the real aircraft does not have a steering wheel, and so does the AFS2 version...but differential braking does not work that well in my implementation). 
Do not expect any kind of support from my side - as usual I'll try to help if I can, but this product is not officially supported.

This model features:
- Detailed visual model of SIAI-Marchetti S-211
- Visually detailed virtual cockpit, with basic functionality and preliminary night lighting
- Multiple liveries including JPATS, Phililppine Air Force and Singapore Air Force 
- Basic, easy to fly flight model
