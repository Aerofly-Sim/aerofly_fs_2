# Cessna 172 Mod
Aerofly FS 2 User-Made Aircraft Collection

# Installation

This installation process will result in two Cessna 172s in the selection, one will be this cold and dark mod, the other one will be the original aircraft. (The mod will be towards the end of the selection list, not next to the original aircraft)

- 1) Go to your installation directory of the Aerofly FS 2 in the Steam apps, which is usually at
“C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Aerofly FS 2 Flight Simulator”
- 2) Open the folder “aircraft” and copy the entire original “c172” folder. (Make sure not to touch the content of this folder during this installation!)
- 3) Open your documents folder and open the folder “Aerofly FS 2” (C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Aerofly FS 2) and open the subdirectory “aircraft”
- 4) Delete any previous folder “c172mod”
- 5) Now paste the “c172” folder from the clipboard into the currently opened subdirectory “aircaft” and rename it to “c172mod”.
- 6) In that new “c172mod” folder rename the file “c172.tmb” to “c172mod.tmb”
- 7) Except for the options.tmc file delete all “.tmd” and “.tmc” files in the “c172mod” folder.
- 8) Downloading the zip file decompress it in a local directory.
- 9) Copy all files from the download and paste them in the new “c172mod” folder.
